Write a function named countLetter that will take a string and return a count of each letter in the string. For example, "I live in Liverpool” contains 2 e's, 4 i's, 3 l's, 2 o’s, 2 v’s, and one each of r, p, and n. Your function should take a single string argument and return a dynamically allocated array of 26 integers representing the count of each of the letters a . . z respectively. Your function should not be case sensitive, i.e., count 'A' and 'a' as the occurrence of the letter a. Do not count non-letter characters (i.e., spaces, punctuation, digits, etc.). Test your function by calling it in the main function and by asking the user to enter a string as an input. Print out the counter of each letter which is stored in the returned array. Do not list letters that do not occur at least once.
#include <iostream> 
#include <time.h> 
using namespace std;
int * countLetter(string ); 
int main( ){
string input;
cout<<"Hello!!! Please input any phrase you wish to utilized: "<<endl; getline(cin,input);
int * counter= countLetter(input);
for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
if(counter[i]!=0){
cout<<(char)(i+97)<<" "<<counter[i]<<endl;
    } 
}
delete [] counter;
cout<<"Thank you so much!!"<<endl; return 0;
}
int * countLetter(string input){
int * counter=new int[26]; for(int i=0;i<26;i++ ){
counter[i]=0;
}
for(char c:input){
if(65<=c&&90>=c){ c+=32;
} 
if(97<=c&&122>=c){
counter[(int)c-97]++; 
}
}
return counter; 
}
